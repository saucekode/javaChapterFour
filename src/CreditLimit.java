/*
* What are we helping this Bloom store achieve?
* - This store wants to know when a customer has exceeded their credit limit on a charge account.
* What is credit limit? This is the maximum amount you can borrow using a credit card. It is issued by the bank or credit union.
* The credit card issuer assesses your income, credit history and current debt level before issuing a credit limit
* There is credit limit and card balance
 */

/*
* - Let us say HI to Jane who purchases regularly from Bloom.
* - We want Bloom to know when Jane has exceeded her credit limit so she can't purchase anymore on credit based on her credit balance
*
* - What qualifies Jane for a store credit in Bloom?
*
* - She must:-
* ## Have an account number
* ## Have a balance at the beginning of the month
*
* - Without these two things above, she can't really do anything credit in Bloom
*
* ## Total of all the items she has charged for the month
* ## Total of all credits applied to the Jane's account for the month
* ## Her allowed credit limit
*
* HOW MIGHT WE DO THIS?
* - Input:-
* - Jane's account number
* - Her balance at the beginning of the month
* - Her purchases for the month
* - Credits applied to her account for that month
* - Her allowed credit limit
