/*
* Let me get into the mind of this driver
* - The driver keeps track of several trips by recording the miles he drove
*   and the gallons of fuel he used for each tankful.
* - Probably, this driver has been keeping track of
*   all this information on paper and trying to calculate it himself, so we need to help him.
* - So, how do we help him?
* - Since he writes down the miles he drives and also the gallons he probably uses paper
* - Then, he needs to calculate his miles travelled per gallon manually and get an average of all of them
* */

/*
* - THE APPLICATION FOR JOHN THE DRIVER
*   - He can start the app by inputting any number
*   - He can end the app by inputting -1
*   - He can input the number of miles he drove
*   - He can input the gallons of fuel used for every trip
*   - Calculate miles per gallon
*   - Get the average of the trips taken
*   WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY HELPED JOHN BUILD AN APP TO HELP HIM INPUT HIS TRIPS AND GET AN AVERAGE OF THEM ALL!!!!
